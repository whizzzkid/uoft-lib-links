## Problem
While searching for for academic research papers I come across various papers I cannot view, because I need to pay for them. But being a student, I have access to University of Toronto library. The library has paid subscriptions to major journals, but I need to go through the links provided by library to access these resources.

## Solution
This extension automatically overrides the urls and takes you through UofT library's paid subscription.

## Contribution
Feel free to send me PRs if you find new UofT suscription links to journals. I'll accept and push to webstore.
